The goal of hcesR is to create a package that will help with the analysis of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data. A good source of HCES data is [the world bank microdata repository](https://microdata.worldbank.org/). The package will contain functions that will help with the analysis of HCES data. The package also contains a [sample_hces.dta](dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/data/sample_hces.dta) used to demonstrate the use of the functions in the package, you can download this data after installing the package by running `hcesNutR::sample_hces()` in your R console. The package is still under development and will be updated regularly.

# `hcesNutR` Package

The goal of the hcesNutR project is to create a repository of functions and data that will help with the analysis of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data. A good source of HCES data is [the world bank microdata repository](https://microdata.worldbank.org/). 

The package contain functions that will help with the analysis of HCES data. The package also contains the sample data used in this book i.e. [r4hces-data/mwi-ihs5-sample-data](dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/data/r4hces-data.zip) We will use this sample data to demonstrate the use of the functions in the package. The package is still under development and will be updated regularly.

## Reporting bugs

Please report any bugs or issues [here](www.github.com/dzvoti/hcesNutR/issues).

## Installation

You can install the development version of hcesNutR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dzvoti/hcesNutR")
```

As we discussed in previous chapters you need to load the package in your R session before you can use it. You can load the package by running the following code in your R console.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(hcesNutR)
```

## Functions in the package
You can view the functions in the package by running the following code in your R console.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ls("package:hcesNutR")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
You can read the functions and their description on the project website at: [dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/reference/index.html](dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/reference/index.html)

## Sample data
The data used in this example is randomly generated to mimic the structure of the [Fifth Integrated Household Survey 2019-2020](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3818/related-materials) an HCES of Malawi. The variables and structure of this data is found [here](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3818/related-materials)

:::{.callout-tip}
All functions in this package take a dataframe/tibble as input data. This is by design to allow flexibility on input data. The example used here is for use on stata files with `.dta` but the functions should work with `.csv` files as well.
:::

### Import and explore the sample data
Import the sample data from the `r4hces-data/mwi-ihs5-sample-data` folder. Use the `read_dta` function from the `haven` package to import it.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Import the data using the haven package from the tidyverse
sample_hces <-
  haven::read_dta(here::here("data", 
                             "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                             "HH_MOD_G1_vMAPS.dta"))

```

### Trim the data
In this example we will use `hcesNutR` functions to demonstrate processing of `total` consumption data. The `total` consumption data is the data that contains the total consumption of each food item by each household. 

The other consumption columns contain values for consumption from sources i.e. gifted, purchased, ownProduced. The workflow for processing the "other" consumption data is the same as demonstrated below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Trim the data to total consumption
sample_hces <- sample_hces |>
  dplyr::select(case_id:HHID,
                hh_g01:hh_g03c_1)
```

## `hcesnutR` Workflow 

### Column Naming Conventions and Renaming

The `sample_hces` data is in stata format which contains data with short column name codes that have associated "question" labels that explain the contents of the data. To make the column names more interpretable, the package provides the `rename_hces` function, which can be used to rename the column codes to standard hces names used downstream. 

The `rename_hces` function uses column names from the `standard_name_mappings_pairs` dataset within the package. Alternatively, a user can create their own name pairs or manually rename their columns to the `standard` names. 

It is important to note that all downstream functions in the `hcesNutR` package work with standard names and will not work with the short column names. Therefore, it is recommended to use the `rename_hces()` function to ensure that the column names are consistent with the package's naming conventions. 

For more information on how to use the `rename_hces` function, please refer to the function's documentation: [`rename_hces`](https://dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/reference/rename_hces.html).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Rename the variables
sample_hces <- hcesNutR::rename_hces(sample_hces,
                                     country_name = "MWI",
                                     survey_name = "IHS5")
```

### Remove unconsumed food items
HCES surveys administer a standard questionaire to each household where they are asked to conform whether they consumed the food items on their standard list. If a household did not consume a food item, the value of the 'consYN' is set to a constant. The `remove_unconsumed` function removes all food items that were not consumed by the household. The function takes in a data frame and the name of the column that contains the consumption information. The function also takes in the value that indicates that the food item was consumed.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Remove unconsumed food items
sample_hces <- hcesNutR::remove_unconsumed(sample_hces,
                                           consCol = "consYN", 
                                           consVal = 1)
```

### Create two columns from each dbl+lbl column
The `create_dta_labels` function creates two columns from each dbl+lbl (double plus label) column. The first column contains the numeric values and the second column contains the labels. The function takes in a data frame and finds all columns that contains the double plus label column. The function returns a data frame with the new columns.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Split dbl+lbl columns
sample_hces <- hcesNutR::create_dta_labels(sample_hces)
```


### Concatenate columns
Some HCES data surveys split consumed food items or their consumption units into multiple columns. The `concatenate_columns` function cleans the data by combining the split columns into one column. The function can exclude values from contatenation by specifying the whole or part of values to be excluded. 

#### Concatenate food item names
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Merge food item names
sample_hces <-
  hcesNutR::concatenate_columns(sample_hces,
                                c("item_code_name", 
                                  "item_oth"),
                                "SPECIFY",
                                "item_code_name")

```

#### Concatenate food item units
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Merge consumption unit names. For units it is essential to remove parentesis as they are the major cause of duplicate units
sample_hces <-
  hcesNutR::concatenate_columns(
    sample_hces,
    c(
      "cons_unit_name",
      "cons_unit_oth",
      "cons_unit_size_name",
      "hh_g03c_1_name"
    ),
    "SPECIFY",
    "cons_unit_name",
    TRUE
  )

```

:::{.callout-tip}
Use the `select` and `rename` functions from the dplyr package to subset the columns containing food item name , food item code, food unit name and food unit code. This is to ensure that the names are meaningful and consistent with the package's naming conventions.
:::

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_hces <- sample_hces |>
  dplyr::select(
    case_id,
    hhid,
    item_code_name,
    item_code_code,
    cons_unit_name,
    cons_unitA,
    cons_quant
  ) |>
  dplyr::rename(food_name = item_code_name,
                food_code = item_code_code,
                cons_unit_code = cons_unitA)

```
### Match survey food items to standard food items
The `match_food_names` function is useful for standardising survey food names. This is feasible due to an internal dataset of standard food item names matched with their corresponding survey food names for supported surveys. Alternatively users can use their own food matching names by passing a csv to the function. See hcesNutR::food_list for csv structure.

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_hces <-
  match_food_names_v2(
    sample_hces,
    country = "MWI",
    survey = "IHS5",
    food_name_col = "food_name",
    food_code_col = "food_code",
    overwrite = FALSE
  )

```

### Match survey consumption units to standard consumption units
The `match_food_units_v2` function is useful for standardising survey consumption units. This is feasible due to an internal dataset of standard consumption units matched with their corresponding survey consumption units for supported surveys. Alternatively users can download our template from `hcesNutR::unit_names_n_codes_df` and modify it to use their own consumption unit matching names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_hces <-
  match_food_units_v2(
    sample_hces,
    country = "MWI",
    survey = "IHS5",
    unit_name_col = "cons_unit_name",
    unit_code_col = "cons_unit_code",
    matches_csv = NULL,
    overwrite = FALSE
  )

```

### Add regions and districts to the data
Identify the HCES module that contains `household identifiers`. In some cases this will already be present in the HCES data and should be skipped. From the `household identifiers` select the ones that are required and add to the data. In this example we will add the region and district identifiers to the data from the `hh_mod_a_filt.dta` file.
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Import household identifiers from the hh_mod_a_filt.dta file
household_identifiers <-
  haven::read_dta(here::here("data",
                             "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                             "hh_mod_a_filt_vMAPS.dta")) |>
  # subset the identifiers and keep only the ones needed.
  dplyr::select(case_id,
                HHID,
                region) |>
  dplyr::rename(hhid = HHID)

# Add the identifiers to the data
sample_hces <-
  dplyr::left_join(sample_hces,
                   household_identifiers,
                   by = c("hhid", "case_id"))

```


### Create a `measure_id` column
The `create_measure_id` function creates a measure id column that is used to identify the consumption measure of each food item. The function takes in a data frame and the name of the column that contains the consumption information. The function also takes in the value that indicates that the food item was consumed.

The `measure_id` is a unique identifier that allows us to join the consumption data with the food conversion factors data. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Create measure id column
sample_hces <-
  create_measure_id(
    sample_hces,
    country = "MWI",
    survey = "IHS5",
    cols = c("region",
             "matched_cons_unit_code",
             "matched_food_code"),
    include_ISOs = FALSE
  )

```

### Import food conversion factors.
The available data comes with a `food_conversion fcators file which has conversion fcators that link the food names and units to their corresponding 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Import food conversion factors file
IHS5_conv_fct <-
  readr::read_csv(
    here::here(
      "data",
      "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
      "IHS5_UNIT_CONVERSION_FACTORS_vMAPS.csv"
    )
  )
```



We need to check if the conversion factors file contain all the expected conversion factors for the hces data being processed. The `check_conv_fct` function checks if the conversion factors file contains all the expected conversion factors for the hces data being processed. T

:::{.callout-warning}
Remember this data was randomly generated so it is expected that the weights will not be realistic. Also not all food items have conversion factors so the weight of those food items will be `NA`.
:::

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check conversion factors 
check_conv_fct(hces_df = sample_hces, 
               conv_fct_df = IHS5_conv_fct)
```

### Calculate weight of food items in kilograms.
The `apply_wght_conv_fct` function will take the `hces_df` and `conv_fct_df` and calculate the weight of each food item in kilograms. 

:::{.callout-warning}
Remember this data was randomly generated so it is expected that the weights will not be realistic. Also not all food items have conversion factors so the weight of those food items will be `NA`.
:::

```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_hces <-
  apply_wght_conv_fct(
    hces_df = sample_hces,
    conv_fct_df = IHS5_conv_fct,
    factor_col = "factor",
    measure_id_col = "measure_id",
    wt_kg_col = "wt_kg",
    cons_qnty_col = "cons_quant",
    allowDuplicates = TRUE
  )

```

### Calculate AFE/AME and add to the data

:::{.callout-tip}
## Assumptions
The ame/afe factors are calculated using the following assumptions:
-   Merge HH demographic data with AME/AFE factors
-   Men's weight: 65kg (assumption)
-   Women's weight: 55kg (from DHS)
-   PAL: 1.6X the BMR
:::

#### Import data required 
In order to calculate the AFE and AME metrics we require the following data:
- Household roster with the sex and age of each individual `HH_MOD_B_vMAPS.dta`
- Household health `HH_MOD_D_vMAPS.dta`
- AFE and AME factors `IHS5_AME_FACTORS_vMAPS.csv` and `IHS5_AME_SPEC_vMAPS.csv`

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Import data of the roster and health modules of the IHS5 survey
ihs5_roster <-
  haven::read_dta(here::here("data",
                             "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                             "HH_MOD_B_vMAPS.dta"))
ihs5_health <-
  haven::read_dta(here::here("data",
                             "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                             "HH_MOD_D_vMAPS.dta"))

# Import data of the AME/AFE factors and specifications
ame_factors <-
  read.csv(here::here("data",
                      "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                      "IHS5_AME_FACTORS_vMAPS.csv")) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

ame_spec_factors <-
  read.csv(here::here("data",
                      "mwi-ihs5-sample-data",
                      "IHS5_AME_SPEC_vMAPS.csv")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  # Rename the population column to cat and select the relevant columns
  dplyr::rename(cat = population) |>
  dplyr::select(cat, ame_spec, afe_spec)
```

#### Extra energy requirements for pregnancy
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Extra energy requirements for pregnancy and Illness
pregnantPersons <- ihs5_health |>
  dplyr::filter(hh_d05a == 28 |
                  hh_d05b == 28) |> 
  # NOTE: 28 is the code for pregnancy in this survey
  dplyr::mutate(ame_preg = 0.11, afe_preg = 0.14) |> 
  dplyr::select(HHID, ame_preg, afe_preg)

```

#### Process HH roster data
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Process the roster data and rename variables to be more intuitive
aMFe_summaries <- ihs5_roster |>
  # Rename the variables to be more intuitive
  dplyr::rename(sex = hh_b03, age_y = hh_b05a, age_m = hh_b05b) |>
  dplyr::mutate(age_m_total = (age_y * 12 + age_m)) |> 
  # Add the AME/AFE factors to the roster data
  dplyr::left_join(ame_factors, by = c("age_y" = "age")) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    ame_base = dplyr::case_when(sex == 1 ~ ame_m, sex == 2 ~ ame_f),
    afe_base = dplyr::case_when(sex == 1 ~ afe_m, sex == 2 ~ afe_f),
    age_u1_cat = dplyr::case_when(
      # NOTE: Round here will ensure that decimals are not omited in the calculation.
      round(age_m_total) %in% 0:5 ~ "0-5 months",
      round(age_m_total) %in% 6:8 ~ "6-8 months",
      round(age_m_total) %in% 9:11 ~ "9-11 months"
    )
  ) |>
  # Add the AME/AFE factors for the specific age categories
  dplyr::left_join(ame_spec_factors, by = c("age_u1_cat" = "cat")) |>
  # Dietary requirements for children under 1 year old
  dplyr::mutate(
    ame_lac = dplyr::case_when(age_y < 2 ~ 0.19),
    afe_lac = dplyr::case_when(age_y < 2 ~ 0.24)
  ) |>
  dplyr::rowwise() |>
  # TODO: Will it not be better to have the pregnancy values added at the same time here?
  dplyr::mutate(ame = sum(c(ame_base, ame_spec, ame_lac), na.rm = TRUE),
                afe = sum(c(afe_base, afe_spec, afe_lac), na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  # Calculate number of individuals in the households
  dplyr::group_by(HHID) |>
  dplyr::summarize(
    hh_persons = dplyr::n(),
    hh_ame = sum(ame),
    hh_afe = sum(afe)
  ) |>
  # Merge with the pregnancy and illness data
  dplyr::left_join(pregnantPersons, by = "HHID") |>
  dplyr::rowwise() |>
  dplyr::mutate(hh_ame = sum(c(hh_ame, ame_preg), na.rm = T),
                hh_afe = sum(c(hh_afe, afe_preg), na.rm = T)) |>
  dplyr::ungroup() |>
  # Fix single household factors
  dplyr::mutate(
    hh_ame = dplyr::if_else(hh_persons == 1, 1, hh_ame),
    hh_afe = dplyr::if_else(hh_persons == 1, 1, hh_afe)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(HHID, hh_persons, hh_ame, hh_afe) |>
  dplyr::rename(hhid = HHID)

```

#### Enrich Consumption Data with AFE/AME 

We will use the `left_join` function from `dplyr` to join the consumption data with the `aMFe_summaries` data. 

The `left_join` function will join the `aMFe_summaries` data to the `sample_hces` data by matching the `hhid` column in both data sets. 

The `left_join` function will add the `hh_persons`, `hh_ame` and `hh_afe` columns to the `sample_hces` data. 

The `hh_persons` column contains the number of people in each household. The `hh_ame` and `hh_afe` columns contain the AME and AFE factors for each household.


```{r eval=FALSE}
sample_hces <- sample_hces |> 
  dplyr::left_join(aMFe_summaries)
```

Now we have a "clean" data set that we can use for analysis. 

## Summary
This chapter demonstrated the use of the `hcesNutR` package to process HCES data. The package contains functions that will help with the analysis of HCES data. 

The package also contains the sample data used in this book i.e. [r4hces-data/mwi-ihs5-sample-data](dzvoti.github.io/hcesNutR/data/r4hces-data.zip) We used this sample data to demonstrate the use of the functions in the package. 

The package is still under development and will be updated regularly.Please report any bugs or issues [here](www.github.com/dzvoti/hcesNutR/issues).

## Future work
-   Add more functions to the package
-   Support more surveys (NGA Living Standards Survey 2018-2019)
-   Add more internal data to the package
-   Add more documentation to the package
