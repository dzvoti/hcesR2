The goal of hcesR is to create a package that will help with the
analysis of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) data.
The package will contain functions that will help with the analysis of
the data. The package will also contain a dataset that will be used to
demonstrate the use of the functions in the package. The package will
also contain a vignette that will be used to demonstrate the use of the
functions in the package.
